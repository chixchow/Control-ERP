# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Any FLS team member can ask a business question in plain English and get an accurate, formatted answer from their ERP data.
**Current focus:** Wave 1 - Phases 1, 2, 3 (parallel)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 8 (Wiki Knowledge Formalization — Wave 1)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-08 -- Completed 03-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 12.5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 3min28s
- Total execution time: 0.12 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 2min43s | 2min43s |
| 03 | 1 | 4min12s | 4min12s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 2min43s, 4min12s
- Trend: Verification tasks running longer than core skill updates

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap v2]: Eliminated standalone audit phase -- audit checks folded into actual work phases
- [Roadmap v2]: 8-phase structure with 4-wave parallelism (3+2+2+1) -- max throughput with 5 concurrent agents
- [Roadmap v2]: All SALES-* requirements consolidated into Phase 4 (was split across Phases 5 and 8)
- [Roadmap v2]: DOC-* and milestone close merged into single Phase 8 (was Phases 9+10)
- [01-01]: Type 7 StatusID 28 means Closed not Open - corrected in core skill
- [01-01]: Types 3, 4, 10 documented from wiki despite zero FLS records for completeness
- [01-01]: StatusID 3 standardized to "Sale" singular throughout all documents
- [01-01]: Revenue queries require explicit SaleDate IS NOT NULL filter
- [03-01]: All 12 extracts verified as GOOD quality (exceeds 6 required) - second extraction pass identified high-value domains

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Existing phase2-test-results.md shows tests already passing -- Phase 7 may be largely re-execution for formal scorecard
