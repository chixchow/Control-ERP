## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap v2]: Eliminated standalone audit phase -- audit checks folded into actual work phases
- [Roadmap v2]: 8-phase structure with 4-wave parallelism (3+2+2+1) -- max throughput with 5 concurrent agents
- [Roadmap v2]: All SALES-* requirements consolidated into Phase 4 (was split across Phases 5 and 8)
- [Roadmap v2]: DOC-* and milestone close merged into single Phase 8 (was Phases 9+10)
- [01-01]: Type 7 StatusID 28 means Closed not Open - corrected in core skill
- [01-01]: Types 3, 4, 10 documented from wiki despite zero FLS records for completeness
- [01-01]: StatusID 3 standardized to "Sale" singular throughout all documents
- [01-01]: Revenue queries require explicit SaleDate IS NOT NULL filter

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Existing phase2-test-results.md shows tests already passing -- Phase 7 may be largely re-execution for formal scorecard
- Wiki extracts count is 12 on disk but requirement says 6 -- Phase 3 will reconcile
